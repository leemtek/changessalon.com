            <description>Rachelle - Esthetician - My passion for makeup skin care and wellness started at a very young age and lead me to school to acquire a license in skin care. My main goal is to educate others on how to take care of their skin. I have had the pleasure of working with Changes Salon and Day Spa for 5 years. I studied Esthetics at the San Fransisco Institute of Esthetics and Cosmetology - A Paul Mitchell Partner school in San Fransisco, CA. I've had great opportunities to work with amazing skin care lines such as, Cosmedix and Karin Herzog while at Changes. I have gone through Medical Esthetic training provided by Cosmedix. I enjoy doing makeup applications for people who want to look their very best for everyday or special events such as weddings, proms, photo shoots, or just because they want to feel beautiful. I'm well known for my waxing skills as being fast and efficient while trying to make my clients feel as comfortable as possible. I'm proud to be able to offer a relaxing, educational spa experience for every client the addresses their unique skin care goals.
